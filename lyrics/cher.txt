Don't get me started, love
I've had too much to drink
Had too much time to think
So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself
'Cause of what they think about you
Makes time go slow, slow, slow, yeah
Makes time go slow, slow, slow, slow
Something's gotta give soon
Or I'm gonna lose it
Substance abusing
And never come down, down
Fall off the deep end
And forget my English
What's the point of language
If you don't say what you feel?
So, with that being said
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass that's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and Mimosas
Champagne and cocaine
Help to get me through
Ten in the morning
And I'm skipping breakfast
And drinking a beverage 
To ignore it all
Guess ignorance is bliss and
I've come to embrace it
It's all overrated
Except drugs and alcohol
So, with that being said
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass that's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and Mimosas
Champagne and cocaine
Help to get me throughAfter love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? 
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, noHey, do it now
Yeah, hey
Hey, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a Rock and Roll Band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burnin' down the one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly 
To disco down and check out the show
Yeah, they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groove
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted:
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die
Oh ya, ya
I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish 
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way
I said, I must go back there 
And check to see if things still the same
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die, ya
'Til you die
Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better 
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' 
Of how I learned my lesson that day
When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die
Oh' till you die
They shouted play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music rightIf I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
Oh, baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
If I could reach the starsUh!
Mmm, yeah
La la la la la 
Uh!
Hey, boy, you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away, way, way 
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns 
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this

Want, want you, want you back 
Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryna rock them ugly, jeans, jeans, jeans 
You clearly didn't think this through 
If what I've been told is true 
You'll be crawling back like, boo-hoo-hoo 
Remember all the things that you and I did first? 
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first, uh-oh, uh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yo
Remember all the things that you and I did first?

Does that sound like a helicopter? Brrr163 
För evigt 
163 för evigt, för evigt
Jag kom direkt från lilla Mogadishu, bror
Rullar upp me Shukz, Abdihakim och Zozo
Från rondellen där legender föds 
Tyvärr samma rondell där vart legender dött, det för många
Lyssna, ljusen tända för dom som lämnat
Inga nämnda men aldrig nånsin glömda 
Änglarna från Västerort
Svär det känns som era vingar dom har gett mig luft
Känns tufft, nu snurrar världen runt i erat namn
Bakk, jag sjunger om byn ner i Amsterdam
Hitta gäri i Paris, dom ba shoo madame
Stasha euro i min bank, ge mig lacagta
Det e Sherihan, baby
Jag e på min vibe, jag e på min vibe
Hustlar dygnet runt—vilken 9 to 5?
Låt mig leva life, låt mig leva life
För om jag lyckas då vi alla kan, vi alla kan
163 för evigt, för evigt
163, 163 för evigt, för evigt
Cherrie och Z, a-alla ska äta
Ra-raderna täta, Vilda V, vi e gäähda
Inget är samma, vi gör inte som andra
Ha respekt för din mamma om du vill hamna i Jannah
Solbrännan i pannan
Vi går upp när vi ramlar
Om vi kan då du kan, tro inte nåt annat
När det vi två på beatet
Mord, ring till polisen
Det låter fint, man får rysningar
När Cherrie hon sjunger—
Jag e på min vibe, jag e på min vibe
Hustlar dygnet runt—vilken 9 to 5?
Låt mig leva life, låt mig leva life
För om jag lyckas då vi alla kan, vi alla kan
163 för evigt, för evigt 
163 för evigt, för evigt 
Den där drömmen, nu jag lever den
Är på topp men aldrig glömt mitt hem, nej, nej
För jag visa vägen med sanningen
Jag lärde mig, blev mästare
Sen gav mitt allt för dom bakom mig
Jag e på min vibe, jag e på min vibe
Hustlar dygnet runt—vilken 9 to 5?
Låt mig leva life, låt mig leva life
För om jag lyckas då vi alla kan, vi alla kan
163 för evigt, för evigt 
163 för evigt, för evigt Oh, my god, this is so fucking rare where'd you find this
So rare, such a gem
I'm a shark attack, bitch, you ever seen one in the summer?
It's getting dark, marked the coordinates because here I come to
Rip this track to shreds until they're muh-fuckin' slumbers
Now that I'm fed I'm gonna bring the thunder cut the strings and beat the drummer
Shit, kick boy wonder to the side first
Spit slime, slurp wine,  drive cursed
Ch-ch-check the meter, speeding in the wide hearse
I'm a sin seeker, skull fuck the grim reaper
And did it again but deeper
Now I ain't living right but I ain't living wrong neither
See the way I hopped to the scotch, adjust the notch and bust the fucking speakers
Oh it's too loud? You want me to turn it down?
I didn't know that you could hear it from the bleachers
Go tell the teacher I don't give a fuck
Know why?
This is that basket rap in case you lacked the matter of fact like a rat
Trapped, action packed like a blunt wrapped in plastic wax
My flow is casted like a lass an duwhacks
You off your horse, of course
So map your tracks so we don't knock you off your course
Then I chop with an axe
Hatchet grasps and casket naps, listening for that gasp
Please relax as I run laps around these tracks
Like the cherry on my bitches blunt wraps
Fucking busting knee caps
Mind your own beeswax
My nut sack, you will relapse then drown in this tree sap
I heard ya packed your bags and don't know when you'll be back
Believe that
Oddy Nuff, Odd-Oddy-Oddy-Oddy Nuff, Oddy
Nuff-Nuff, Oddy Nuff, Odd-Oddy Nuff da Snow
Leopard, Snow-Snow Leopard, Snow Leopard-Leopard-Leopard
Snow Leopard, Oddy Nuff da Snow Leopard

Shoutout to my boy Chucky What
The fuck you got?Gråter, pratar snabbt
Vänta, hör dig knappt
Snälla älskling, ta det lugnt
Berätta va han nu gjort
Klart det relevant var han sov inatt
Kan du sluta va så dum?
Du borde packa dina saker mitt i natten
Ta din väska och gå 
Jag kan inte hålla käften
När jag innerst inne vet hur du mår 
Så ta och packa dina saker
Ta en taxi, bara åk därifrån 
Den där tönten kan va ensam
Han är ingen riktigt kille ändå 
Han har gjort fel, gör rätt val, lämna han
Vuxen man precis som ett barn, ba lämna han
Behandlar dig som du är ingenting, ha? Vem är han?
Ringer fast du redan vet svar, ba lämna han
Lyssna, lämna han
Saker har kommit fram
Jag har hört han träffar nån
En tjej på röda linjen
Kanske inte han, va?
Hör du på ditt snack?
Han ljuger nog om var han sov 
Tania kom förbi igår
Du låter dig luras av de ni har
Till punkten det känns som det varje dag
Och hur kan du ens vilja stanna kvar?
När han inte backar dig
Du borde packa dina saker mitt i natten
Ta din väska och gå 
Jag kan inte hålla käften
När jag innerst inne vet hur du mår 
Så ta och packa dina saker
Ta en taxi, bara åk därifrån 
Den där tönten kan va ensam
Han är ingen riktigt kille ändå 
Han har gjort fel, gör rätt val, lämna han
Vuxen man precis som ett barn, ba lämna han
Behandlar dig som du är ingenting, ha? Vem är han?
Ringer fast du redan vet svar, ba lämna han
Han har gjort fel, gör rätt val, lämna han
Vuxen man precis som ett barn, ba lämna han
Behandlar dig som du är ingenting, ha? Vem är han?
Ringer fast du redan vet svar, ba lämna han
Säg vad du vill, det bara sanning men du så naiv
Du måste hitta tillbaks till ditt liv
Tro vad du vill, han kommer aldrig att ändra sin stil
Han kommer aldrig bli någon prins
Du borde packa dina saker mitt i natten
Ta din väska och gå 
Jag kan inte hålla käften
När jag innerst inne vet hur du mår 
Så ta och packa dina saker
Ta en taxi, bara åk därifrån 
Den där tönten kan va ensam
Han är ingen riktigt kille ändå 
Han har gjort fel, gör rätt val, lämna han

Nu är det upp till dig, bara upp till dig
Nu är det upp till dig, bara upp till dig
Nu är det upp till dig, bara upp till dig
Bara upp till dig
Bara upp till dig

Freaking perfect and five foot ten, just wanna punch her lip 
'Cause I know I've been wasting time, trying to get your eye
Yeah, I know that I've been so blind, thinking that I'm your type
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone
'Bout to pick up the telephone
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah

Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause if I want you, I gotta have that

'Cause if I want you, I gotta have that
Uh, huh, yeah
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real
Boy, you're the one I want

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
Always so special
Made for each other
You will stay on my mind
For always
And forever
You will be my Saturday love
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain

Feeling so special
Made for each other, girl
Staying on my mind, girl
Girl, you know I can't leave you behind
There's never any question
You will be my Saturday love
When I look at you
Special feelings, special times
I thought we'd always be together
But sometimes things just
Don't work out like we planned
Life goes on and people grow
Out of things
That fit before
But Saturday remains the same
And I hope it'll never change
For always and forever
You will be my 
You will be my 
You will be my 
Be 
My Saturday love
Do do do do
Let's sing it together
Never on Sunday

Tuesday and Wednesday
Just won't do
Thursday and Friday
We can begin
But our Saturday love
Will never end, sugarYo, my best friend, best friend 'til the very end
'Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you
'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts
And don't forget all the trouble we got into
We got something you can't undo, do
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
I know I drive you crazy, hmm, sometimes
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times
But you complete me, and that's no lie
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie
We in the car, sing, sing, singing our song
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we King Kong
And in my eyes, you can't do, do no wrong
You got a best friend sing, sing along
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
Oh, I'll never let you go
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Oh, just thought that you should know
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Yeah

That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you
Oh, you should know, you should know
You should know, you should know, yeah
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
This is my oath to youJag vill inte vara din flickvän, det har jag redan vart
Du vinklar allt som de mitt fel, det har du redan sagt
Du säger du ska ändra dig men jag tror det knappast
Inget kan förändra dig, du tänker bara para
Trodde vi va på riktigt men den känslan försvann
I samma stund som du sticker, kommer tårarna fram
Du och dina lögner, ni går hand i hand
Förtjänar mycket bättre, tog mig tid att fatta
Låg i sängen på en lördag
Framför TV:n men vad gör jag?
Mina känslor, de är sköra
Hela världen ska få höra
Det var länge sen men har lärt mig
Vara ensam, jag är starkast
Händer aldrig igen
Händer aldrig igen
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen
Du ringer mig när du inser att du behöver mig där
Har blivit kall som en vinter, tror du känner mig, va?
Snälla sluta stressa mig, jag behöver andas
Jag vet vad som e bäst för mig och jag tror jag backar
Trodde vi va på riktigt, varför kändes det falskt?
Så fort jag fick lite insikt, då förändrades allt
Först så vill du lämna mig, nu så vill du stanna
Förtjänar mycket bättre, tog mig tid att fatta
Låg i sängen på en lördag
Framför TV:n men vad gör jag?
Mina känslor, de är sköra
Hela världen ska få höra
Det var länge sen men har lärt mig
Vara ensam, jag är starkast
Händer aldrig igen
Händer aldrig igen
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen
Yo, I pull up outside, all I saw was a black bag 
Pocket full of dreams in a black cab 
And I reckon that I tried to prevent it 
So why'd you always talk like I'm that bad
It's kinda funny how you tell your friends one thing
Then you tell me that you love me on the rebound
And it kinda hit me hard when it sunk in
That I had you by your neck but you're free now
Yeah, go and fly baby, spread your wings
Yeah man, we both went and said some things
Truth ain't pretty and my words cut deep
It was all about me, you was blessed with a king
Not knowing that I was the blessed one, I was the lucky one
I had the good side, damn, that's another one
I pause and I bill my spliff
You should never have to feel like this
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen
För jag vill inte må sådär
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Vem vill må sådär? Jag vill inte må sådär
Säg mig, vem vill må sådär? Vem vill må sådär?
Jag vill inte må sådär, jag vill inte må sådär
Händer aldrig igen, händer aldrig igen

You don't wanna feel like this
Why should you feel like this?
Wanna feel like this
You don't wanna feel like this
You don't wanna feel like thisI'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated
Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
What you want to be
And lately it ain't been the same at all
When you're here its like I'm invisable
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong
Cuz I'm feeling
I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated
Lately our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower and then say I'm gone
What am I to do
With my heart just leave
But my feet won't move
Today is our anniversary
But you haven't even say two words to me
I'm trying hard to give you another chance
But ooh baby I'm feeling
I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated
Oh when I first met you
I thought you was the most perfect man
That I ever seen
I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I use to give into your lust
Now I see the truth
Oh no I don't want to hear it all through
Yea I know I'll still be missing you
But it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel
Unappreciated
I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated
Don't love me no more
Heeey wooo hooo
Unapreciated
I'm feeling unappreciatedI was a lone wolf
I thought I lost my pack
Where are my ladies?
Nobody has my back
Girl, I should've stayed
Maybe another day
When I'm wide awake
I told you
I told you, I told you I'd be with the guys
But I know better now than to be with the guys
I was a lone wolf
I thought I lost my pack
Where are my ladies?
I guess that was my fault
Girl, I should've stayed
Maybe another day
When I'm wide awake
I told you
I told you, I told you I'd be with the guys
But I know better now than to be with the guys
Now, now I see the beauty
It's necessary
To give a lady love
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Now, now, now I see the beauty
It's necessary
To give a lady love
Oh oh, oh oh oh ohI've took the fast lane all of my life
I've been a bad girl, I've been the good wife
I don't stop to think, when I go in, I go in
I've fallen hard like a million times
On number 7 of my 9 lives
The ink on my skin, is all the places I've been
Oh my God , I'm such a sucker 
I fall in love  with every fucker 
But oh no, I won't apologise

Love made me do it and I'd do it again
I did my time on the yellow brick road
I saw some shit that'd make your head explode
Had to do what I do, just to get me to you
And all my friends are like, "Woah, girl stop"
'Cause they're the ones who pick the pieces up
It's bad for my health but I just can't help myself
Oh my God , I'm such a sucker 
I fall in love  with every fucker 
But oh no, I won't apologise
Nah, 'cause I'm
Breaking all my rules

And the wind is so icy, I am numb

With the thousand eyes on me, I stumble on
I am tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
I carry the weight of you
I carry the weight of you
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens calling
We follow the sun down low 'til we hit the night
And you hold me so tightly, it's hard to breathe, oh
And I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
We follow the sun down low
We follow the sun down low
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens calling
The sirens calling
Yeah, I'm tired, I'm growing older
I'm getting weaker every day, yeah
I am drowning, and you're stealing every breath
Take me away and just...
Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still
Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirens calling
The sirens callingЯ сижу шестые сутки
Дома в соло, скукота
Всё, что греет меня ночью -
Тело моего кота
Я пью пиво до рассвета
В своей комнате одна
Мне так нравится всё это
Но я вовсе не хиккан
Дело в том, что тут туманы -
Застилают двери в мир
Дело в том, что тут туманы -
Застилают двери в мир
Я люблю курить и плакать
И ходить босиком
Я люблю мечтать и верить
С пледом и косяком
Я люблю курить и плакать
И ходить босиком
Я люблю мечтать и верить
С пледом и косяком
Хорошо, что нету парня -
Плохо то, что нет тебя
Человека, что осилит
Вывозить меня всегда
Я конечно не подарок -
И уж точно не фонтан
Но ведь каждому так нужен
Понимающий братан
Я люблю курить и плакать
И ходить босиком
Я люблю мечтать и верить
С пледом и косяком
Я люблю курить и плакать
И ходить босиком
Я люблю мечтать и верить
С пледом и косякомMilkshakes and cat eyes
Lipstick and french fries

Don't make us feel belittled, world

Don't know where I'm goin' but the wind is blowin'
Smokeless but no way of knowin'
I'll be fine once the wind stops blowin'
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your gaze
I know that you notice my ways
And I feel, I feel your gaze

You look at me like I'm crazy, baby

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the high hat
Go on, mmmm, that's good!
Now the tambourine, right now!
Mmmm, woo, yeah, DJ!
Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo
Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo
Huh, sukka?
Gigolo
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in ever way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Get funky
Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is!
Check out this DJ
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in ever way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Smokin' not cokin'
Get funky sax
Looking good, hang in with the Wild Bunch
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass, rock this place!
What is he like? What's he like anway?
Yo man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean?
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me
Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep
Deeper into your soul
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
No moneyman can win my love
No moneyman can win my love

If you want a bite
Go fly a kite
Got the bread, got the cheese
Make me a grilled cheese, please
Try and steal a bite
We'll get in a fight
Grilled cheese
In my mouth
Get on your knees
If you want a bite
Go fly a kite
It's all about the butter
Make one for your mother
Then I'll make you another
Oh

Get on your knees
If you want a bite
Go fly a kite
Grilled cheese

Grilled cheese
In my mouthThey say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if all that's true
Cause you got me, and baby I got you
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got flowers in the spring, I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
Babe
I got you babe, I got you babe
I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

Your love is shining down on me, like a diamond in the sky
Diamond in the sky, love in the sky
Your love is shining down on me, like a diamond in the sky
Your love is shin-, Your love is shin-
Your love, your love
DJ $crim with that 808
Don't know your bitches
'Cause I got a different style
I hold you for a while
While I keep a smile
Pasted on their face
Getting naked at my place
Without a trace
She needs to raise basically
Blazin' up the file cabinet like a campfire
Directed the "Vietnam"
Mixing tapes like they were wise
Looking to give into my desires
What, you think that you were hot?
Sh- sh- shut the fuck up
Lookin' ass stuff
Oddy Nuff eatin' the chicken as it is
Check it, prep it
Fryin' grill, bake, boil, barbecue that shit
But you can have the vegetables
I'm impregnable
I'm tryna' let you go
And it's intentional
Sexual favours
I savour the flavour
But you gotta leggo of my eggo
Before you getting prego
B- b- because I said so
So chill out
And get the pill out
Before I spill out
These little kids
And have to fill out
A fuckin' birth certificate
Now what's worse than that?
Well, I don't fucking know...
I'm 'bout keepin' up the muffin'
Without heatin' up your oven
I'm 'bout keepin' up the muffin'
Without heatin' up the oven
Oh- oh- oh- oh baby
I don't want no baby
What, you crazy?
I pull out the lazy card if you keep it up
No, not keepin' my dick up
Then I wanna keep you stuffed
Nut busted in the Kleenex
Cause I believe you lost my trust
That's why, 
I wrap it up like it's your birthday
Gettin' up like it's a work day
You can even call me "first place"
If you charm my snake
The way your body move
The way your curves sway
I'm thirsty
Let me get sip of your shake
Now I'ma rise from side to side
And up and down
For miles, thousands
Go 'round and 'round
From heavy pettin' to the pound
They tryna' hide so I pull out
No doubt
I'm 'bout the sex
Call me chex with the trix
Best after the fix
To let me rest
Slide off my kicks
Get outta line
I'm callin' next
If you called about a kid
I ain't kiddin' I do my own biddin'
Shit
I'm 'bout keepin' up the muffin'
Without heatin' up your oven
I'm 'bout keepin' up the muffin'
Without heatin' up your oven

Welcome to Burlesque
Everything you dream of
But never can possess
Nothing's what it seems
Welcome to Burlesque
Oh, everyone is buying
Put your money in my hand
If you got a little extra
Well, give it to the band
You may not be guilty
But you're ready to confess
Tell me what you need
Welcome to Burlesque
You can dream of Coco
Do it at your risk
The Triplets grant you mercy
But not your every wish
Jesse keeps you guessing
So cool and statuesque
"Behave yourself" says Georgia
Welcome to Burlesque
Oh, everyone is buying
Put your money in my hand
If you want a little extra
Well, you know where I am
Something very dark
Is playing with your mind
It's not the end of days
It's just a bump and grind
Show a little more
Show a little less
Add a little smoke
Welcome to BurlesqueFeeling broken, barely holding on
But there's just something so strong
Somewhere inside me
And I am down, but I'll get up again
Don't count me out just yet
I've been brought down to my knees
And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking
But I can take it, I'll be back, back on my feet
This is far from over
You haven't seen the last of me
You haven't seen the last of me
They can say that I won't stay around
But I'm gonna stand my ground
You're not gonna stop me
You don't know me, you don't know who I am
Don't count me out so fast
I've been brought down to my knees
And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking
But I can take it, I'll be back, back on my feet
This is far from over
You haven't seen the last of me
There will be no fade out, this is not the end
I'm down now, but I'll be standing tall again
Times are hard, but I was built tough
I'm gonna show you all what I'm made of
I've been brought down to my knees
And I've been pushed way past the point of breaking
But I can take it, I'll be back, back on my feet
This is far from over, I am far from over
You haven't seen the last of me
No, no, I'm not going nowhere
I'm staying right here
Oh, no, you won't see me begging
I'm not taking my bow, can't stop me
It's not the end
You haven't seen the last of me
Oh, no, you haven't seen the last of me
You haven't seen the last of meLa la la la la la la love

Swore I would never be that girl holding your hand
Look at you gazing, acting like your biggest fan
I used to make fun of all the things that they said
Saying I will never be like that
But then you showed up like you had been there before
Was like you knew me, had me with every word
You saw right through me, melted me down to the core
I was done when you walked through that door
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love
So call me baby, in front of all of your friends
It used to shake me, but would you say it again?
It's a weird feeling, we're laying here in the dark
And I don't wanna fight this spark
You got me flying, don't wanna ever come down
I'm realising I kinda need you around
Hard to believe it, I'm that girl holding your hand
And I'm still trying to understand
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love
Whistle, I like it when you blow the whistle
You make me wanna ch-bang bang bang bang bang, baby
I don't own a pistol
My tongue wagging when you wiggle
I'll end up kissing you with or without the mistle
Love the open toes and the clothes even though we ain't official
You official, you official
When you see me in a suit, say I'm so smooth criminal
Playing hard to get - girl, you're being too difficult
Let me in your mind 'fore I get to the physical
I ain't tryna mess with any woman - that's typical, need original
Lips and eyes
Big surprise if she have hips and thighs
Kissed her twice, now she say I'm Mr Right
She had my D, now she dickmatised, whoa lord
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid loveLOS
Jump 
Man this goes out to
Anybody who ever lost someone
Or anybody who ever had like a
A big motivation to do something in life
Man dont let anybody get in your way
Do what you want to do
I mean
People laughed when I said I was going to be a rapper
Look at me now
JD get 'em Jump 
Headed for the top and we never coming back down
Taking hip hop and we picking up the slack now
Came from nothing like straight out of ghost town
3,2,1 Now you see us on the count down
I got a house in the mountains
So I'm climbing up the count down
People blowing up my phone
 Where's my shout out
Shh God damn, quiet it down loudmouths
I got to go buy some shoes that aren't even out now
Go hard like Viagra
Flows like Niagara
 running right past yah
Sorry son I might lap yah
I'm serious as f***
This is no happy gillmore
I'm about to shut the game down
Look out on your billboard
Almost had a couple kids
Had to get my mind right
Homie this is my mic
My choice, it's my life
Let the kush line light
Unbrighten my eyesight
Shine right, rush back from London
Check the time right
Kept it 100 with my mask  for the thugs
Had everybody in a good mood in the club
Like he's a white dude and everybody showing love
Death threats on my phone and I still don't give a f***
So I'm
Headed for the top and we never coming back down
Taking hip hop and we picking up the slack now
Came from nothing like straight out of ghost town
3,2,1 Now you see us on the count down
 I am back now
Picking up the slack now
Thanks for the song your welcome on the doormat now
So just roll a blunt five dance clap now
Horns in the background
Bass high hat now
And like the breaststroke, I will never back down
Stand up guys get dropped lay back down
I do it for the struggle
I do it for the tramp house
I do it for Saint Lewis
My family's friends Frat house
Go ask yourself is  the shit like manuer yet
Sold out shows he ain't even on tour yet
Coming for the charts
This is real 3,2,1
Snipe on top but feel free, 2, 1
Shit, life had a count down
Took to many meds
Heart stopped beating, big rush to the head
I woke up days in that hospital bed
Rip the ivy off my chest
Man it's time to get some bread
Cause I'm
Headed for the top and we never coming back down
Taking hip hop and we picking up the slack now
Came from nothing like straight out of ghost town

Break down your door, then I'll push you on the floor
I don't wanna be seen, I don't wanna be heard
I feel like a turd, why are you looking at her?
When's this going to go away?
I have all these crazy pains
When's this shitty party going to dissipate?
I am irate
White's not my color this evening
I might act super tough but it's really not enough
I'll kick straight through your wall, then I'll blame it on them all
This is a nonsense call, I can still have a ball
When's this going to go away?
I have all these crazy pains
When's this shitty party going to dissipate?

Mer pengar mer shuula i min världI don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta goWho's that whisperin' in the trees?
It's two sailors and they're on leave
Pipes and chains and swingin' hands

A stray cat frontin' up an eight-piece band
Cut me Sammy and you'll understand
In my veins hot music ran
You got me in a sway
And I want to swing you down
Now you sailors know
Where your women come for love
Zoot suit riot 
Throw back a bottle of beer

Pull a comb through your coal black hair

Steppin' on the scene when I was a teen, and I'm cleaner
In your mama's kitchen stitching up my dreams, I dream of
Believe her
When life gives me lemons, I am a squeezer
No sugar added 'cause I don't need to be sweeter
I'm better put together than a burger and fries
With that milkshake on the side

Become the bomb that you give me your life
I'm outta sight

As your feet tap to my jam, I slam
People be like "O-double-D-Y god damn!"
Can he kick it? You better believe I can
Honeys be like "Can we blow this Popsicle stand?
'Cause you the man with the plan
And I can't understand why you won't let me hold your hand
And now i'm in the moment feelin' you gon' make me throw a tantrum"
Then I say "Okay, you can come home with me
In the dinosaur land, huh, check it"

Yeah, and it's like this but it's like that too
Flock to the shepherd, the coolest of all the cats
I'm a snow leopard, chillin' tundra status
With the baddest, bunch of villains, the illest
But ain't no need to grab a penicillin
What you feelin' right now is a side effect
Pipe down, Oddy Nuff spittin', I'm not showin' my respect
So reflect what the kid called kallokie when I spit

We wear our underpants three days in a row
My room smells like an ashtray
My room smells like an ashtray
Wearing a smile and a heart on my sleeve
Collect your weary mind
Unbend and breathe unwind
Face the setting sun
There is no time to start over
My carpet smells like beer forever, forever
If all the people dressed like sheeple
There would be no color, no color
Those are my people
There would be no color, no color
Those are my people
We can't live a nine-to-five
Art is love and love is sloppy
Nothing is all pure
Nothing is all dirty
Trash people, oh, trash people

In a cold and empty bed, yeah
Shaking off the dream of you
I got shit to do and I'm ready to forget, aw yeah
I heard you brought that girl around in half a gown
And asked if I've been there, oh yeah
Ask me how I'm doing now, I scream aloud
I tell 'em I don't care
And I don't care
I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care
And everywhere
There are ordinary hearts that don't play fair
But I don't care

In this town, word gets around, it don't bring me down
It's just static in my head, yeah
So take me out and turn it up
Let's make it rough, we're gonna wake the dead, oh baby
Everyone is saying now to slow it down
Or I'll get hurt again, oh yeah
When these sins are feeling me
It's healing me and screaming I don't care
And I don't care
I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care

There are ordinary hearts that don't play fair

Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway, oh
I can see the Milky Way
And it seems so far away, oh

Just another pretty face
Disappears without a trace
There ain't nothing left to say
I don't care, feels so good, oh
I don't care, oh I don't care
I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care

Woo!Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called you mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang, you shot you down
Bang bang, and I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me downI don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned
Won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody
They wanna push me down
They wanna see you fall down
Won't tell anybody how you turn my world around

Too much of anything can make you sick
Even the good can be a curse 
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt
Is it better, is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse?
It's just like we're going backwards 
I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let's go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash, no
Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growin' apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back
Back to the start
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having, Ii's worth fighting for
Now every day ain't gon' be no picnic
Love ain't a walk in the park
All you can do is make the best of it now
Can't be afraid of the dark
Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growin' apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back
Back to the start
Anything that's worth having

I'm willing and ready to go
We've been driving so fast
We just need to slow down, and just roll
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight

Oddy Nuff on the beat
$crim, G*59
Lemme talk my shit, mane
Fuckyboi
My hoe left me, don't give a fuck
Car broke down, don't give a fuck 
Chillin' with Oddy like we give a fuck
Her head real sloppy, don't give a fuck
Long as I fuck and catch my nut
Maybe slip it in her butt, that's a fuck-and-duck
Eating Popeyes with some lemonade
Not real shit, just Minute Maid 
Maybe go to Hell for my sinning ways
But don't give a fuck, I'm livin' life today 
Woke up at eight, donuts and grapes
Eggs and steak on my dinner plate
Call the crew like what it do?
Don't give a fuck, tell me what's the move? 
Read the paper, watch the news
Like I give a fuck, but I play it smooth
Got fired today, don't give a fuck
She feelin' tired, she won't let me fuck
So I jerk my dick and think of bubble butts
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, but I live it up
And I sip it up, and I sniff it up
And I lit it up, but now I'm sick as fuck
And I spilled the cup, but I licked it up
Passed out late, don't give a fuck
Woke up late, don't give a fuck
In bed I stayed, don't give a fuck
Forgot to bathe, don't give a fuck
My dirty ways, they come in waves
Because some days I'm way too depressed to give a fuck
I dress like I could give a fuck
I been a duck, so don't call, I ain't picking up
$crim text me, say "Bitch, get up"
I text him back, "I'm twisted up"
He knows what that means
That means I'm not slackin', I'm just twisted up
The sad thing is y'all give a fuck
Suck up the luck, bitch, what the fuck?
Oddy Nuff the Mutt got his dick sucked by your sister's butt
I'm Mister "Fucked in the Head"
Mister "Fucked Your Girl in Your Bed"
No head, because your bitch is dental
Sick as the mental
Now let me hear this motherfucking beat go instrumental
$crim and Nuff don't give a fuck
$crim and Nuff don't give a fuck
$crim and Nuff don't give a fuck
$crim and Nuff don't give a fuck
Fuck giving up, don't give a fuck
Fuck giving up, don't give a fuck
Fuck giving up, don't give a fuckI'm feeling really unappreciated
You're takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated
Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
What you want to be
And lately it ain't been the same at all
When you're here, it's like I'm invisible
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong
Cause I'm feeling
Lately our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower, and then say "I'm gone"
What am I to do when my heart
Says leave, but my feet won't move
And today is our anniversary
And you haven't even said two words to me
I'm trying hard to give you another chance
But, ooh, baby, I'm feeling
Boy, when I first met you
I thought you were the most perfect man
That I ever seen
And I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I used to give into your lies
But now I see the truth
Oh, no, I don't want to hear it all though
Yeah, I know I'll still be missing you
But it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel
Unappreciated
Don't love me no more
Hey, woo, hoo
Unapreciated
I'm feeling unappreciatedI'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm a machine, couple screws loose, but I'm running smoothly
Know what I mean, got an upgrade, now I'm more unruly
I'm hard to swallow, but a spoonful of sugar
Might make it go down more easily
Pick up the beat, put your money on me
I'm not the Queen, but I'm gonna be a princess on it
Like premium gasoline, my words gonna catch on fire
Spread through your body like heat
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

Yo, I'm the type of man who puts the truth on the track
The future of rap, Righteous!
You ain't gonna ask who's that
D-d-d-do you know that already? Are you mad?
Got to track, go to X-Factor, prepare for the next chapter
I'm back with a bag full of gifts like Santa
We don't care if you're naughty or nice
Yo, Cher, I beg you talk to them liars
Laugh in the hater's face, save your praises
We ain't got time for that, ain't got patience
Soon you'll move with my friend's hit, I'll say
You can't switch your station
Can't say artists just hit the A-list
Can't touch this 'cause I'm in a spaceship
I'm into raving, one thing I'll say is;
Yeah, I'm about to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
Work hard, party harder!
Work hard, party harder!
Work hard, party harder!
Work hard, party harder!
I'm a psycho, no Simon
I'm fly with no co-pilot
Oh so grime-ish, gimme the beat, I'm so violent
The way I got the rhythm and beat, there's no finding anything like this
Common Joe's shining
I know they're watching me like they got no eyelids
Killing ‘em like a Baretta when it spits
You ain’t ever been equipped, you ain’t leveling with this, I’m cold
Got MC's that have been in the game
For 10 years depressed and stressed thinkin' I'm old
Im a deep guy and highly streetwise
I always speak life just how it is, I'm road
I spit nothing but slugs on the track
Hollow tips and class A drugs on the track
Its Dot, you know how I does on the track
Cher's certified with a thug on the track
BLAOOWWWW!
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

I swear, who ever came up with this idea, genius!
It's quite clear, I mean this
Besides Cher, I might give her the wood like IKEA
I'mma relax like the wife's hair, no
I'mma relax like my wife's here
Let me get back to the music
These MC's ain’t meeting the criteria
That's why I'm here, lighting it up like times square
Lighting it up like mind flares
Everyone gon' talk about wavy
Where they when the tides near?
Yahh, I lost the buzz but it's back
'Cause I'll be the type to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track
I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the track

I'm the kinda girl to put dub on the trackThe beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La de da de de, la de da de da
Charleston was once the rage, uh huh
History has turned the page, uh huh
The miniskirt's the current thing, uh huh
Teenybopper is our newborn king, uh huh
And the beat goes on, beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La de da de de, la de da de da
The grocery store's the supermart, uh huh
Little girls still break their hearts, uh huh
And men still keep on marching off to war
Electrically they keep a baseball score
And the beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La de da de de, la de da de da
Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss
The cars keep a going faster all the time
Bums still cries, "Hey buddy, have you got a dime?"
And the beat goes on, the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La de da de de, la de da de da
And the beat goes on, yes, the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
The beat goes on and the beat goes on
The beat goesI walked into the kitchen
And I said "Hey, baby, what's cooking?"
Tapatío baked into the pizzas
Sometimes steak fajitas
Ooh, margarita
Ooh, turn the heat up
Shake that sugar, sugar
I'll take another
I'm a beignet lover
Hot donut, I'm covered
I'll try not to hover
Food coma recover
And I know
He'll be down for something later tonight
Humble pro
Fry that shit on low
Cook it slow

Margaritas, ooh

MargaritasOh baby, baby, don't be sad, you've had a long night
It's all your fault and you know why so stop lying
I'm sure it's hard to sleep at night when you know I'm right
Bougie ass bitch you are not that fine so stop crying, stop crying
Doin' lines in the bathroom stall 
Now every song is her favorite song  Acting better than everyone 
Then going home and crying to mom 
She thinks she's right but she's always wrong 
She's always yelling cause she's high strung 
Rolling her eyes at everyone 
She probably thinks she's too cool for this song
Don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sad, don't be sadHow'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
My name, say my name, baby
It's the love you save for the way I know we’ve been apart
It's an endless circle of poison arrow to my heart
Saying I, I love what you do to me
Need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
My name, say my name, baby
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
My name, say my name, baby
It's a constant thought of my baby taking up my time
It's a non-stop vision of you that's playing on my mind
Saying I, I love what you do to me
Need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
My name, say my name, baby
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel when you call my name?

Say my name, baby
When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name, baby
